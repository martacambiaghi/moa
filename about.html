Hey Iâ€™m Marta ðŸŒ¿
  <p class="trattino">-</p>
   Iâ€™m a communication design student in Milan.
	  I study at Politecnico, and Iâ€™m interest by illustration and UI/UX design
	  Iâ€™m also a barmaid during the weekend.
  	I love visit art galleries, stay in nature, enjoy the sun and skateboarding in my free time.
	  When I can I also love travelling, searching for something inspiring.
